Linear Regression Task
Internship at The Spark Foundation
Overview
This project involves using Linear Regression to predict student scores based on the number of study hours. The task was part of my internship at The Spark Foundation, where I applied basic machine learning techniques to analyze data and make predictions.

Project Details
Language: Python
Libraries Used:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib for data visualization
scikit-learn for implementing the Linear Regression model
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Hours: Number of hours a student studied
Scores: The score achieved by the student
Implementation
Steps Involved:
Data Loading: Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trained a Linear Regression model using the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
Prediction: Used the trained model to predict scores based on the number of study hours.
Key Results:
Mean Absolute Error: 2.97
R-squared Score: 0.97
Mean Square Error: 18.94
Task requirement to predict score for 9.5 hours study which model predicted is : 94.80
