Project Title

 Stock market prediction using numerical and textual dataset

üìÑ Project Description
 
 This project is focused on predicting stock market trends using both numerical data (historical stock prices) and textual data (news headlines). It combines advanced techniques in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and sentiment analysis to generate accurate predictions and actionable insights.

üéØ Who It's For

This project is designed for data scientists, financial analysts, and anyone interested in leveraging data-driven approaches to predict stock market movements. It‚Äôs particularly useful for those who want to explore the impact of news sentiment on stock prices and refine their predictive modeling skills.









üì¶ Packages Used
The project utilizes a variety of Python packages for data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing various machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
XGBoost: For boosting-based machine learning models.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models, specifically LSTM.
NLTK: For text processing.
TextBlob & VADER: For sentiment analysis on textual data.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping news headlines (if applicable).
YFinance: For retrieving historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
üîçModels Used
The project incorporates the following models:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):

A deep learning model used for predicting stock prices based on historical data, leveraging its ability to learn time-dependent patterns.
RandomForest:

An ensemble learning method used for predicting stock prices by averaging the predictions of several decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
XGBoost:

An advanced boosting algorithm that emerged as the top performer in predicting stock price trends, particularly effective in handling complex datasets.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

A machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification tasks, applied here for stock price prediction.
TextBlob & VADER (Sentiment Analysis):

Tools used to perform sentiment analysis on news headlines, contributing sentiment scores that are merged with numerical data for comprehensive modeling.
